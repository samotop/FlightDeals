# FlightDeals
Welcome to FlightDeals, a dynamic and innovative application that showcases the extensive skills and knowledge I've acquired during my journey in learning Python programming. This project stands as a testament to my expertise, demonstrating the real-world application of my coding proficiency.

# Project Overview:
This project initially emerged as a training ground for honing my programming skills. Using Python, I've developed a sophisticated flight search engine leveraging the powerful Tequila API from Kiwi.com. The program's functionality is robust and multifaceted:

<b>Automated Flight Search:</b>

The application diligently scours flights based on specified API parameters using the Tequila API. When it finds a flight that meets the criteria, it sends me an SMS to my registered phone number, complete with flight details and a convenient link for purchasing tickets.

<b>User Subscription Feature:</b>

Later, I added a subscription feature allowing users to opt into this service. Upon program execution, if suitable flights are found, it sends an email to all registered users, furnishing them with comprehensive flight information, including departure and arrival cities, pricing, departure, and arrival dates, along with a hyperlink for seamless ticket purchase.

<b>Smart Data Management:</b>

The program employs a Google Sheet table where I've meticulously inputted primary city names and historically low flight ticket prices. Before conducting searches, the program validates the data, automatically populating any missing IATA codes for cities. It then filters flights based on the provided parameters and prices, looking for options from tomorrow up to six months into the future.

<b>Key Technologies Used:</b>

Tequila API by Kiwi.com

Sheety API

Twilio API

# Installation
Due to the complexity of this project, which involves handling sensitive data stored as environment variables, installation requires meticulous setup, including multiple registrations and configurations. This intricacy serves as a testament to my adeptness and commitment to implementing robust security measures.

<b>Note:</b> For potential employers interested in understanding the implementation details and witnessing the functionality in action, a detailed walkthrough and demonstration can be provided upon request.

Thank you for considering FlightDeals â€“ a testament to my passion, skills, and dedication to the world of programming.
